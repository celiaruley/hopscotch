<h1>Conversations</h1>

<h3>Over the past few months, I've found my friends and I talking more and more
  on the subject of education. Both about our experience within the education system,
  our frustrations with it, and the ways we see it can be changed. Recently,
  my good friend Nori hosted a Zoom panel on youth activism in my hometown. Nori spoke
  with Aminah Jenkins, Aissa Dearring, and Kris Smith about their experience organizing
  within our hometown of Durham, North Carolina, as well as their experience in the education system there.</h3>
