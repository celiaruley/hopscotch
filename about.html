<p> Reading and writing open up possibilities for people to explore
their potential and ideas. Despite this, it is not easy to learn to
read & write and there is no one way to learn how to either. </p>
While most curricula would have you think otherwise, as one way of teaching must be prioritized,
this website is dedicated to showing different perspectives and learning styles to help make more information
more accessible. </p>
