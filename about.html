 <h3>hop·scotch</h3>
   <h4>/ˈhäpˌskäCH/</h4>

<p> For the past five months, I have found myself thinking about the education
  system and how much reading, writing, and language affect our everyday lives.
  This fall semester, I've been noticing small connections between all of my
  classes and the conversations I've been having with friends. The reoccurring theme is learning and education,
  so I've been trying to find a way to connect it all, to make sense of it.</p>

  <p> As a result, this website was created as a place to house those connections,
    ideas, and conversations I've between having over a five month period. To see if when I pull back,
    if there is a structure to them.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this website is inspired by feeling curious, discovering connections, and
  connecting ideas to find better ways of teaching and learning within the
  education system and outside of it. I think of learning like playing hopscotch --
  everyone who plays uses different squares to get to the same destination,
  showing there is no one way to learn.</p>

  <p>As you move around this site, I hope it gets you thinking. There are many
    important things that make a space accessible when it comes to learning and
    education, such as:</p>

<p>• material accommodates different learning styles and students needs</p>
<p>• environment is warm, welcoming</p>
<p>• students feel supported and curious</p>
<p>• students feel a sense of purpose, community and belonging</p>
<p>• opportunities for growth and challenges</p>

<p>These things are possible within a learning environment, but
  they're often not felt. Let's change that.</p>
