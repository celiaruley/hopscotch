  <h1>About this website</h1>
  <h2>“Education is a human right with immense power to transform. On its foundation rest the cornerstones of freedom, democracy and sustainable human development.”
 -Kofi Annan</h2>
<p> For the past five months, I have found myself thinking about the education
  system and how much reading, writing, and language affect our everyday lives.
  I’ve always loved to read, and I can remember an exact moment when I realized
  I could. I was probably around 7 years old and had been learning to read from
  my mom (I was homeschooled).
  At the time, my mom was driving us somewhere on the highway and I was looking
  out the window, lost in thought. We passed by a sign that probably
  read off some street names and a next exit. I saw the words, connected their
  meaning and realized in a moment, how all of this information fit together and
  presented itself for me to understand where I was going. All of the sudden, I
  felt the world communicating and connecting to me in a way I hadn’t experienced
  before.</p>

<p>This website is inspired by feeling curious, discovering connections, and
  connecting ideas to find better ways of teaching and learning within the
  education system and outside of it. Poke around, and see if the content here
  sets off any ideas or thoughts for you. If you have any ideas or thoughts
  on your own experience learning, inside and outside of the education system,
  please share by clicking over to the page “Thoughts”.</p>

  <p>There are many important things that make a space accessible when it comes to learning and education.

<p>• Material accommodates different learning styles and students needs</p>
<p>• environment is warm, welcoming</p>
<p>• students feel supported and curious</p>
<p>• students feel a sense of purpose, community and belonging</p>
<p>• opportunities for growth and challenges</p>
